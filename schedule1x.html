We are organizing a <tt>p4est</tt> summer school
sponsored by the
<a href="https://www.hcm.uni-bonn.de">Hausdorff Center for Mathematics</a>
at the <a href="https://www.uni-bonn.de/">University of Bonn</a>, Germany.
Please see also the school's <a

<h2>Slot 11: Welcome and introduction (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaPCsYoa_B0&list=PLGEB5h5rzbTsQuQ-7wub17xUT9AjYQOfP&index=1">video</a>)</h2>

We would like to begin by welcoming y'all to our online event.
The organizers CB, LW and ToI have written nearly all of the <tt>p4est</tt>
code, which came to life on Friday, November 23rd, 2007.
We think it is due time to share our perspectives on the code, inside
information on algorithms and concepts, and guidance on its use and extension
with our growing user base.
</p>
<p class="book">
DC and TiH have contributed a lot to other software libraries that rely on
<tt>p4est</tt> for scalable adaptivity, namely ForestClaw and deal.II.
They will share knowledge on their respective favorite codes and how these
interface to <tt>p4est</tt> and exploit the potential of dynamic adaptive mesh
refinement (AMR).
</p>
<p class="book">
This session is meant as a brief meet and greet and to give an overview of our
schedule and the nature of our tutorials.

<h2>Slot 12: A brief tour of <tt>p4est</tt> (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwvkujZ6lCA&list=PLGEB5h5rzbTsQuQ-7wub17xUT9AjYQOfP&index=2">video</a>)</h2>

<tt>p4est</tt> is a software library that implements parallel algorithms and
data structures that are efficient and convenient to enable dynamic tree-based
adaptive mesh refinement (AMR).
</p>
<p class="book">
This session highlights some core concepts, design choices and functionalities.
Using some of our builtin algorithms, new users can quickly learn to create
adaptive meshes and to manipulate them in parallel.
</p>
<p class="book">
We will also hint at some basic logical concepts and further material for
self study.
We close with pointing at exercises that we encourage to work on until
the Tuesday lectures.
The <a href="schedule2x.html#s22">next lecture of this set</a>
will focus more on theory and in-depth discussion.

Toby will talk about using <tt>p4est</tt> as mesh backend for PETSC-based
simulations.  PETSc is a well-known parallel linear algebra and solver toolkit
used for developing large-scale simulations around the world.
This is the first session out of three on the topic.
